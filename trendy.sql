As VP of Design, he oversees UX and industrial design teams for Fitbit’s line of health-tracking wearables. Before that, Becker spent fifteen years running design studio One & Co., which HTC bought in 2013. We asked him how he works.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Location:</strong> San Francisco</p>\r\n<p><strong>Current Gig:</strong> VP of Design, Fitbit</p>\r\n<p><strong>One word that best describes how you work:</strong> Relate</p>\r\n<p><strong>Current mobile device:</strong> I’m trying to decide what phone to get next right now! I’m currently switching between a couple HTC phones and a Nextbit Robin (my friend/former business partner, Scott Croyle, was head of design there)</p>\r\n<p><strong>Current computer:</strong> MacBook Pro 13\"</p>\r\n<h4><strong>First of all, tell me a little about your background and how you got to where you are today.</strong></h4>\r\n<p>My mom is a graphic designer and has been on faculty at CCA in San Francisco since I was very young, so I was exposed to all the design disciplines. Her home studio gave me lots of opportunity to play with all sorts of design tools, and I knew from a young age that I wanted to be a designer.</p>\r\n<div class=\"ad-container js_ad-video row ad-wide ad-top js_ad-video-desktop\">\r\n<div class=\"ad-instream ad-instream--elastic instream-permalink ad-instream__initial\">\r\n<div class=\"elastic__wrapper\">\r\n<div class=\"ad-unit js_ad-unit ad-video js_ad-video\"> </div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<p>Prior to getting a degree in Industrial Design from CCA, I went to U.C. Berkeley to get a broader liberal arts degree (in Philosophy) and play on the tennis team. I spent a good part of my career building One & Co, a San Francisco design agency that worked with brands ranging from Nike and Adidas to Microsoft and Amazon. My partners and I eventually sold our business to HTC to build a design team that would help drive the company’s pivot to a consumer-facing brand (and launch the world’s first Android phone).</p>\r\n<p>In 2015 I left HTC to join Fitbit, where I’ve had the great opportunity to combine my professional experience in technology and sports industries with my personal passion for health and fitness. I lead the Industrial Design, UX, and UX Research teams in creating product experiences that help everyone in the world be healthier. I can’t imagine a better way to spend my time!</p>\r\n<h4><strong>What apps, software, or tools can’t you live without?</strong></h4>\r\n<p>Though it may date me, I can’t live without a pen, whether on paper or a whiteboard. For a designer, thinking and visualizing happen simultaneously, and over the years I’ve expanded that skill from sketching specific designs to visually thinking through design strategies, team structures, and many other challenges.</p>\r\n<h4><strong>What’s your workspace setup like?</strong></h4>\r\n<p>I’m rarely at my desk these days, so it’s a pretty basic arrangement. I have a height-adjustable desk with a monitor that I rarely bother to use and a storage cabinet where I keep some personal items (i.e. a gym bag for lunchtime workouts… it is Fitbit of course!).</p>\r\n<p>The rest of the design studio is where “real” work happens. We have dedicated spaces where each program lives from early research/sketch phases all the way through production, a CMF (Color/Material/Finish) lab, and a workshop with all the fun prototyping tools. Much of my time is spent reviewing work with my team in the project rooms. Or in meetings of course.</p>\r\n<h4><strong>What’s your best time-saving shortcut or life hack?</strong></h4>\r\n<p>Biking to work! It means I get at least forty minutes of exercise every day, and it’s much faster and less stressful than driving or public transportation.</p>\r\n<h4><strong>What’s your favorite to-do list manager?</strong></h4>\r\n<p>I use Google Keep on my phone for all things professional and personal. I use it for everything ranging from topics to cover in my 1:1 meetings with James (Fitbit’s CEO) to gift ideas for my wife and kids. That said, all the ideas that strike at bedtime go in a notebook first because my bed is a phone-free space, and my Fitbit takes care of all my sleep tracking and alarms.</p>\r\n<h4><strong>What everyday thing are you better at than everyone else? What’s your secret?</strong></h4>\r\n<p>I’m good at finding simplicity in the noise, whether it’s reducing to the core visual elements in a design to make it feel effortless or defining an effective process for a complex organization.</p>\r\n<h4><strong>What do you listen to while you work?</strong></h4>\r\n<p>I definitely prefer silence when my work requires strategic thinking. I like background music in the design studio, and I definitely like having some music when I’m in a sketch-storm with designers on my team.</p>\r\n<h4><strong>What are you currently reading? Or what’s something you’d recommend?</strong></h4>\r\n<p>I bounce back and forth between reading for fun and reading for personal growth. Within the former category I just finished <a href=\"https://smile.amazon.com/Sympathizer-Novel-Pulitzer-Prize-Fiction-ebook/dp/B00PSSG4MM?tag=lifehackeramzn-20&ascsubtag=9b600b7d4b77a382a745edd937e3a2552dc1b0c0&rawdata=%5Br%7Chttps%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Ftag%2Fhow-i-work%5Bt%7Clink%5Bp%7C1818851043%5Ba%7CB00PSSG4MM%5Bau%7C1530607028%5Bb%7Clifehacker\" rel=\"nofollow\" data-amazonasin=\"B00PSSG4MM\" data-amazonsubtag=\"[p|1818851043[a|B00PSSG4MM[au|1530607028[b|lifehacker\" data-amazontag=\"lifehackeramzn-20\" data-amazonready=\"true\"><em>The Sympathizer</em></a> by Viet Thanh Nguyen and Trevor Noah’s <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Born-Crime-Stories-African-Childhood-ebook/dp/B01DHWACVY/?tag=lifehackeramzn-20&ascsubtag=71e2de63687cbc1a2caee74607b4f25f95f3c908&rawdata=%5Br%7Chttps%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Ftag%2Fhow-i-work%5Bt%7Clink%5Bp%7C1818851043%5Ba%7CB01DHWACVY%5Bau%7C1530607028%5Bb%7Clifehacker\" rel=\"nofollow\" data-amazonasin=\"B01DHWACVY\" data-amazonsubtag=\"[p|1818851043[a|B01DHWACVY[au|1530607028[b|lifehacker\" data-amazontag=\"lifehackeramzn-20\" data-amazonready=\"true\"><em>Born a Crime</em></a>.

In the meantime, she’s released a memoir and YA novel, won an ESPY and a Teen Choice Award, and competed in <em>Dancing With the Stars</em>, <em>Celebrity Apprentice</em>, and a charity episode of <em>Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?</em> We asked her how she gets it all done.</p>\r\n<hr class=\"storybreak-stars\" />\r\n<p><strong>Location:</strong> Nashville, TN<br /><strong>Current Gig:</strong> Influencer/Entrepreneur and Investor on CNBC’s <em>Adventure Capitalists</em> (Tuesdays at 10pm ET/PT)<br /><strong>One word that best describes how you work:</strong> Driven<br /><strong>Current mobile device:</strong> iPhone 7 Plus, waiting for X<br /><strong>Current computer:</strong> MacBook Pro</p>\r\n<h4><strong>First of all, tell me a little about your background and how you got to where you are today.</strong></h4>\r\n<p>I am an Olympic gymnast turned influencer. I competed in the Olympics at the age of 16 and have learned a lot about marketing, branding, and business through the years and have developed a strong interest and passion for the influencer world. It’s not what I ever pictured for myself; I always dreamt of being a doctor. But it’s challenging and unique and constantly keeps me on my toes.</p>\r\n<h4><strong>What apps, software, or tools can’t you live without?</strong></h4>\r\n<p>Instagram, YouTube, YouTube TV, <a href=\"https://www.boomeranggmail.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Boomerang</a>, Final Cut Pro, <a href=\"https://bitly.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Bitly</a></p>\r\n<h4><strong>What’s your workspace setup like?</strong> </h4>\r\n<p>It’s more like a workspace on the go. Since I travel a least once a week I’ve kind of mastered the office in a bag. I travel with my laptop, Bluetooth headphones, Canon 70D and lenses, and all the cords for hookup.</p>\r\n<h4><strong>What’s your best time-saving shortcut or life hack?</strong></h4>\r\n<p>Don’t procrastinate, and make your work time super efficient. I learned early on in gymnastics that the more efficient I was, the more free time I got. So in work I do the same thing.</p>\r\n<h4><strong>What’s your favorite to-do list manager?</strong></h4>\r\n<p>Honestly, an old school paper planner. There is something about writing out my to dos that makes it easier for me to comprehend and digest. If I write it I won’t forget it, and nothing feels better than crossing it out once I’m done.</p>\r\n<h4><strong>What everyday thing are you better at than everyone else? What’s your secret? </strong></h4>\r\n<p>Adapting to change. My schedule, my home, my daily duties tend to change on a daily or hourly basis, so learning to just adapt and roll with it is something I have pretty much mastered.</p>\r\n<h4><strong>What do you listen to while you work? Got a favorite playlist? Maybe talk radio? Or do you prefer silence?</strong></h4>\r\n<p>Either country or <a href=\"http://freakonomics.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Freakonomics</a> … they are my go to.</p>\r\n<h4><strong>What are you currently reading?

What do you do when you want to forget about work?</strong></h4>\r\n<p>Silence and work out!</p>\r\n<h4><strong>What’s your favorite side project?</strong></h4>\r\n<p>Coaching and mentoring—I love working with kids and seeing them learn. Kids have the purest form of passion and drive and it’s inspiring to be around.</p>\r\n<h4><strong>What’s your sleep routine like? Are you a night owl or early riser?</strong></h4>\r\n<p>Oh my… I am 10000% a night owl and definitely not a morning person. I love my sleep and slow mornings filled with coffee and silence. I get all of my work done in the afternoon and later evenings to myself.</p>\r\n<h4><strong>Fill in the blank: I’d love to see ______________ answer these same questions.</strong></h4>\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/user/sxephil\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Philip DeFranco</a></p>\r\n<h4><strong>What’s the best advice you’ve ever received?</strong></h4>\r\n<p>It’s more of a mindset than anything but I was once told by my coach that no matter what I believe… whether I believe I am capable or not… I will always be right. It just taught me at a young age that no matter what, believing in myself and believing in my goal is 99% of the battle.</p>\r\n<h4><strong>Is there anything else you’d like to add that might be interesting to readers and fans?</strong></h4>\r\n<p>I’d say if I were to go back to high school and tell you what my life would look like in 10-20 years, I would have told you that I was going to attend Stanford University and be an orthopedic surgeon. Now my career couldn’t be any different but it makes me happy and challenges me on a daily basis. The point in saying that is a lot of us get caught up in believing we know what our path is, what we are supposed to do, and we get discouraged or blinded when our paths change. Instead of letting change pull you down, embrace it and thrive!</p>\r\n<p><em><small>This interview has been lightly edited for clarity.</small></em></p>', 'blogimage/yribzimnehorxqu6ytp3.jpg', 1, '2017-10-21 08:16:22', '2017-10-23 13:13:30', '<p>Nine years after winning four silvers and a gold in gymnastics at the Beijing Olympics, Shawn Johnson East is joining the investor team on CNBC’s <em>Adventure Capitalist</em>.

During my time at Flickr, I spearheaded a number of technologies that are still commonly used, including APIs, oAuth, and oEmbed, and wrote a best-selling O&rsquo;Reilly book, <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Building-Scalable-Web-Sites-Applications/dp/0596102356?tag=lifehackeramzn-20&amp;ascsubtag=168d841ff05be3750a628e2f25ce95d559d8236c&amp;rawdata=%5Br%7Chttps%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Ftag%2Fhow-i-work%5Bt%7Clink%5Bp%7C1803819796%5Ba%7C0596102356%5Bau%7C1530607028%5Bb%7Clifehacker\" rel=\"nofollow\" data-amazonasin=\"0596102356\" data-amazonsubtag=\"[p|1803819796[a|0596102356[au|1530607028[b|lifehacker\" data-amazontag=\"lifehackeramzn-20\" data-amazonready=\"true\"><em>Building Scalable Web Sites</em></a>. I worked on Flickr at Yahoo for 4 years before leaving in 2009 to start an MMO <em>[massively multiplayer online game]</em> called Glitch with Stewart Butterfield, Eric Costello and Serguei Mourachov, all from Flickr.</p>\r\n<h4><strong>What&rsquo;s your workspace setup like?</strong></h4>\r\n<p>I have a desk in our headquarters, but I&rsquo;m rarely found there. Most of my days are spent in meetings. Given our SF HQ office is 50,000 sq ft, I&rsquo;m able to get most of my 15,000 daily steps during work hours.</p>\r\n<p>However, when I am found at my desk, you&rsquo;ll notice that my desk is usually a mountain of junk. I use a very small laptop (11\" MacBook Air, RIP) but plug into external monitors whenever I can. I&rsquo;m also a mechanical keyboard nerd, and currently use a tenkeyless <a href=\"http://en.varmilo.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Varmilo</a> with blue Cherry MX switches. It&rsquo;s super loud and sounds a bit like a typewriter.</p>\r\n<h4><strong>What&rsquo;s your best time-saving shortcut or life hack?</strong></h4>\r\n<p>Listening to audiobooks at 2&ndash;3x speed. I switched almost exclusively to audio books about 5 years ago, so I could combine my walking commute with reading, but finding the speed setting has been a real boost.</p>\r\n<h4><strong>How do you recharge? What do you do when you want to forget about work?</strong></h4>\r\n<p>Listening to books or podcasts at 3x speed while playing iPhone games; <a href=\"https://kotaku.com/tips-for-playing-bit-city-1793455056\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Bit City</a> is the latest one to catch on in the office. Or, spend time with my 3-year-old son. Nothing forces you to reorient your attention like a toddler.</p>\r\n<h4><strong>What&rsquo;s your sleep routine like?</strong></h4>\r\n<p>I have a very regular sleep schedule: I&rsquo;m typically in bed by 10:30 and asleep by 11:30. I usually spend 30&ndash;60 mins at the end of the day winding down, listening to sci-fi books. I wake up at 7:30am every day.</p>\r\n<h4><strong>You and your co-workers famously developed Flickr and Slack while developing video games. What were these pivots like? What was different the second time around, Slack vs. Flickr?</strong></h4>\r\n<p>The pivots were hard&mdash;no one sets out to fail. You don&rsquo;t know, when you&rsquo;re going through shutting down a failed company, that there will be a good outcome on the other side.</p>\r\n<div class=\"ad-container js_ad-video row ad-wide ad-top js_ad-video-mobile\">\r\n<div class=\"ad-instream ad-instream--elastic instream-permalink ad-instream__initial\">\r\n<div class=\"elastic__wrapper\">\r\n<div class=\"ad-unit js_ad-unit ad-video js_ad-video\">\r\n<div id=\"ad-container-78023427\" class=\"ad-container js_ad-container\" data-media-type=\"INSTREAM_VIDEO_MOBILE\" data-zone-type=\"INSTREAM_VIDEO_MOBILE\" data-instream-position=\"instream_3\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<p>What&rsquo;s been different this time around is the growth and maturity of the web as a platform&mdash;there are 100x more people online everyday. When we built Flickr, the idea of putting your photos online was pretty new. Now the idea of putting them anywhere else is weird.</p>\r\n<p>The other big shift is the development of infrastructure and the cloud. The bar to getting started has gotten lower and lower, allowing you to spend less time racking servers and more time working on the thing you&rsquo;re trying to build.</p>\r\n<h4><strong>What everyday thing are you better at than everyone else? What&rsquo;s your secret?</strong></h4>\r\n<p>That&rsquo;s a bit full-on. I&rsquo;ve been told I have a tremendous capacity for focused work and high-output, but what&rsquo;s allowed me to grow into the CTO role at an org the size of Slack has been my 15-year history of managing teams and the reward I find in the human aspects of the work. There&rsquo;s a very prevalent stereotype that engineers are socially unsophisticated, but that&rsquo;s just not the case. Interpersonal communication is an absolute requirement for management and leadership in all functions of a company, and no less so in engineering. It&rsquo;s a team activity.</p>\r\n<h4><strong>What apps, software, or tools can&rsquo;t you live without?</strong></h4>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Work: Slack</li>\r\n<li>News: BBC, Twitter</li>\r\n<li>Family: Whatsapp, Snapchat</li>\r\n<li>Entertainment: Audible, Reddit</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h4><strong>What&rsquo;s your biggest struggle in the workplace?</strong></h4>\r\n<p>Probably prioritizing my time. As an organization grows in size and complexity, it&rsquo;s easy to fall into just being reactive. There&rsquo;s always one more thing coming to you that wants attention and needs to be done now. But stepping back and being strategic about what you focus on is really important.</p>\r\n<h4><strong>What do you listen to while you work? </strong></h4>\r\n<p>I spend most of my workday in meetings, but when I&rsquo;m working from home I&rsquo;ll plug into Spotify&mdash;this week has been a mix of Kanye and (British trip-hop group) <a href=\"http://www.allmusic.com/artist/sneaker-pimps-mn0000028432\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Sneaker Pimps</a>.</p>\r\n<h4><strong>What are you currently reading, or what would you recommend?</strong></h4>\r\n<p>I recently finished Ada Palmer&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/series/166200-terra-ignota\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Terra Ignota series</a>, which I strongly recommend. A view of humanity post-scarcity and what it takes to hold a society together.</p>\r\n<h4><strong>What&rsquo;s the best advice you ever received?</strong></h4>\r\n<p>I&rsquo;m not sure where this advice came from, but the idea of finding a set of people you like to work with, rather than the perfect project. We didn&rsquo;t set out to make Flickr, or start a company to make Slack, but finding a group of people that you trust and love to work with means that you enjoy what you&rsquo;re doing, even when you pivot into something completely different.</p>\r\n<p>And to drink lots of water and get regular exercise.</p>\r\n<h4><strong>What&rsquo;s the greatest idea you&rsquo;ve had that you don&rsquo;t want to do yourself?</strong></h4>\r\n<p>I still think that what we were trying to do with Glitch (a multiplayer online social game space around would building and collaboration) is a great idea. We didn&rsquo;t manage to make it into a successful business and I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ll try doing it again, but the core of the idea was great. If someone manages to make what we were aiming to, I&rsquo;d play the shit out of it.</p>\r\n<h4><strong>What&rsquo;s your own Slack etiquette, and how much does it line up with the rest of your team? For example, how much do you use Slack during off-hours? Have you ever made a big faux pas like sending a sensitive message to the wrong channel?</strong></h4>\r\n<p>I think I make that mistake more often with email than with Slack, probably because I use it less frequently. While I read Slack at all hours, I try to avoid DMing people late at night. The pressure for people to respond quickly can guilt people into thinking they need to be always on. Queuing up a bunch of messages to send first thing in the morning lets people know that my questions can wait.</p>\r\n<h4><strong>You&rsquo;ve pulled off some great stunts, like the &ldquo;who looks like a manager&rdquo; game at Yahoo. <em>[Henderson&rsquo;s game asked fellow Yahoo employees to guess which of two people was higher up at the company, based only on their photos.]</em> What role have side projects played in your career?</strong>&nbsp;</h4>\r\n<p>I had a lot of fun with the early internal Hack Days at Yahoo, showing that you could build interesting projects that weren&rsquo;t just a user-facing product feature.</p>\r\n<p>Playing Game Never Ending (the game that preceded Flickr) was something I did for fun in my spare time in my early 20s, but <a href=\"http://www.chicagotribune.com/business/success/inc/tca-slack-co-founder-broke-his-way-in-20160429-story.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">&lsquo;hacking&rsquo; into the system to understand more about how the game worked</a> is what ultimately led to being recruited by Stewart to come work at Flickr.</p>\r\n<h4><strong>Fill in the blank: I&rsquo;d love to see _________ answer these same questions.</strong></h4>\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.wired.com/2013/02/facebook-data-team/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Jay Parikh</a> (VP of Engineering at Facebook)</p>\r\n<h4><strong>Is there anything else you&rsquo;d like to add that might be interesting to readers and fans?</strong></h4>\r\n<p>I&rsquo;ve always loved the way you can use software to just make stuff, and get it into the hands of people quickly. If that&rsquo;s something that you enjoy, right now is a great time to get into the industry. There&rsquo;s a lot of opportunities to make things that people use and rely on every day. As an industry we still have a long way to go, but there&rsquo;s never been a better time to pursue a career in software engineering; you don&rsquo;t need to have studied computer science at a prestigious university or come from a &lsquo;typical&rsquo; software engineering background. People from all walks of life who have a great passion for what they do can accomplish a lot.</p>\r\n<p><em><small>This interview has been lightly edited for clarity.</small></em></p>', 'blogimage/exloctudujbwsqcascij.jpg', 1, '2017-10-21 08:19:52', '2017-10-22 08:39:46', '<p>Cal Henderson is the co-founder and CTO of Slack, the leading workplace messaging platform, which Henderson&rsquo;s team invented while trying to build an online game called Glitch.

I didn&rsquo;t have a job, place to live, or friend in the tri-state area. (Incidentally, there is very little in common between Iowa City and New York City.)</p>\r\n<div class=\"ad-container js_ad-video row ad-wide ad-top js_ad-video-desktop\">\r\n<div class=\"ad-instream ad-instream--elastic instream-permalink ad-instream__initial\">\r\n<div class=\"elastic__wrapper\">\r\n<div class=\"ad-unit js_ad-unit ad-video js_ad-video\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<p>I got to where I am like a lot of new arrivals to New York City have&mdash;I went out and introduced myself to complete strangers who had no reason to invest in me or even share their time, and I worked to convince them that, yes, I could deliver what they&rsquo;re looking for. If you do this hundreds of times, you can eventually get somewhere.</p>\r\n<p>Today I&rsquo;m the editor of 99U, an editorial property that is part of Adobe and tells the stories of creative leaders who are mastering their crafts and shaping their industries.

(I&rsquo;ve been at 99U for nearly two years and I&rsquo;ve never really used the filing cabinet drawer at my desk.) I&rsquo;ve also moved my office phone underneath my desk. It took up a lot of space, and if people want to call me they can always get me on my cell. In this age of email and texting, I prefer to talk to people via the phone, because more tends to get accomplished when two people are having an actual conversation.</p>\r\n<h4><strong>What&rsquo;s your best time-saving shortcut or life hack?</strong></h4>\r\n<p>At 99U, we have four people who run a brand that has a total of one million social media followers, publishes a 100-page quarterly magazine, puts on an annual 1,000-person <a href=\"http://conference.99u.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">conference</a> at Lincoln Center&rsquo;s Alice Tully Hall in New York City, and produces stories for a vibrant website. Given this workload, we can&rsquo;t afford to waste any time, so we rarely hold meetings. Our team sits next to each other, so we&rsquo;re talking throughout the day, working through problems in a handful of minutes, rather than holding 60-minute meetings. If we need to work through something more complicated, we like to go out for lunch, and we multi-task and fill that hour with both a good meal and a conversation on whatever topic we&rsquo;re discussing.</p>\r\n<aside class=\"inset--story js_inset branded-item branded-item--lifehacker\">\r\n<figure><img class=\"lazyautosizes lazyloaded\" src=\"https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/s--3gPvpzHI--/c_fill,fl_progressive,g_north,h_77,q_80,w_137/npopsweledbph20ztalc.png\" alt=\"Article preview thumbnail\" data-sizes=\"auto\" /></figure>\r\n<div class=\"inset--story__content\">\r\n<h6 class=\"inset--story__headline\"><a href=\"http://lifehacker.com/how-to-have-a-meeting-that-isnt-a-complete-waste-of-tim-1570834406\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">How to Have a Meeting That Isn\'t a Complete Waste of Time</a></h6>\r\n<p>A badly managed meeting can suck away time, energy and money without being productive for anyone.&hellip;</p>\r\n<a class=\"js_readmore inset--story__readmore\" href=\"http://lifehacker.com/how-to-have-a-meeting-that-isnt-a-complete-waste-of-tim-1570834406\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Read more </a></div>\r\n</aside>\r\n<h4><strong>What&rsquo;s your favorite to-do list manager?</strong></h4>\r\n<p>Pen and paper; to-do items get listed from most to least important.

After a few years of management consulting to pay the bills, I left to help start one of the first online travel agencies. We took that company public in 2003 for over $1B. But I wasn&rsquo;t satisfied with what we had built, so I left and started Kayak.</p>\r\n<p>Since then, Kayak has become a global travel company with local websites in 60 countries and over 2 billion consumer requests for information each year. The Priceline Group bought us in 2013 for $2.1B but nothing&rsquo;s changed in my role. The world is a big place and people need to see it. Our mission at Kayak is to help with that.</p>\r\n<h4><strong>What apps, software, or tools can&rsquo;t you live without?</strong></h4>\r\n<p>Kayak for sure, plus Uber and Waze. I travel all the time and FaceTime keeps me connected to my five daughters and fianc&eacute;e Staci. For work, Slack, Google Docs, and Dropbox. For play, Netflix, Spotify, <a href=\"https://laughable.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Laughable</a> and <a href=\"https://seatgeek.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">SeatGeek</a>.</p>\r\n<p>I&rsquo;m also an Amazon Alexa fan. We just recently upgraded the Kayak skill so that you have the option to book a hotel room with just your voice. We&rsquo;re the first travel company to offer hotel voice-bookings and while it&rsquo;s early days, we&rsquo;re excited about where it&rsquo;s headed.</p>\r\n<h4><strong>What&rsquo;s your workspace setup like?</strong></h4>\r\n<p>Minimalistic. Only a few people at Kayak have offices and I&rsquo;m not one of them. I don&rsquo;t keep much on my desk because we move seats fairly often so our teams have the opportunity to get to know new people. Right now, my seat is right outside of our kitchen.</p>\r\n<h4><strong>What&rsquo;s your best time-saving shortcut or life hack?</strong></h4>\r\n<p>Take real vacations. My out of office messages tell people that their emails will be automatically deleted while I&rsquo;m gone. If it&rsquo;s important, they can tell me when I&rsquo;m back or handle it themselves. Life is too precious and short to always be &ldquo;on.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<h4><strong>What&rsquo;s your favorite to-do list manager?</strong></h4>\r\n<p>I keep a small spiral notebook and write everything down in it&mdash;very old-school for a tech guy. But it&rsquo;s somehow satisfying to scratch completed items off my list, and it helps me have a historical record of what I&rsquo;ve done over time.</p>\r\n<h4><strong>What everyday thing are you better at than everyone else? What&rsquo;s your secret?</strong></h4>\r\n<p>I&rsquo;m great at just about every bar game&mdash;pool, cards, cribbage, cornhole, Connect Four, you name it. I&rsquo;ve probably spent way too much time in bars during my travels.</p>\r\n<h4><strong>What do you listen to while you work?</strong></h4>\r\n<p>The news annoys me these days. So most of the time I listen to Spotify playlists of either Lorde, The Movement, or Willie Nelson.</p>\r\n<h4><strong>What are you currently reading?

It&rsquo;s too funny not to revisit every year. I also recently read Elon Musk&rsquo;s biography which I found inspiring.</p>\r\n<h4><strong>How do you recharge? What do you do when you want to forget about work?</strong></h4>\r\n<p>I&rsquo;m fortunate to live in Miami Beach, and I also have a beach house in Rowayton CT. To relax, I just take my daughters to the beach or on our Chris Craft. I also like working out and cross training.</p>\r\n<h4><strong>What&rsquo;s your favorite side project?</strong></h4>\r\n<p>I love manual tasks like yard work and tinkering with broken stuff. I spend so much time on computers and in tech that it&rsquo;s comforting to actually use my hands in the physical world.</p>\r\n<h4><strong>What&rsquo;s your sleep routine like? Are you a night owl or early riser?</strong></h4>\r\n<p>I aspire to be a night owl, but having two daughters under two makes that really hard. So these days I&rsquo;m an early (and often) riser.</p>\r\n<h4><strong>Fill in the blank: I&rsquo;d love to see _________ answer these same questions.</strong></h4>\r\n<p>Paul English, co-founder of Kayak, and our former CTO. The best leaders know their strengths and deficiencies, and plug the latter with complementary talent. Paul is everything that I&rsquo;m not, which was essential to our success in the early days.</p>\r\n<h4><strong>What&rsquo;s the best advice you&rsquo;ve ever received?</strong></h4>\r\n<p>Be likable. It seems silly, I know. But people have a choice of whom to be around, and if you&rsquo;re likable, they&rsquo;re more likely to share information and ideas, work better together, and be productive. Kayak&rsquo;s office culture and environment reflect that idea too. We want our folks to have surroundings that add energy to their lives and enjoy coming to work.</p>\r\n<h4><strong>Is there anything else you&rsquo;d like to add that might be interesting to readers?</strong></h4>\r\n<p>While most of my time is spent thinking about how to make Kayak&rsquo;s travel services and tools even better, I also think more broadly. I&rsquo;m always on the lookout for how to make life simpler. There&rsquo;s so much wasted time, effort, and capital in the world.</p>\r\n<div class=\"ad-container js_ad-video row ad-wide ad-top js_ad-video-mobile\">\r\n<div class=\"ad-instream ad-instream--elastic instream-permalink ad-instream__initial\">\r\n<div class=\"elastic__wrapper\">\r\n<div class=\"ad-unit js_ad-unit ad-video js_ad-video\">\r\n<div id=\"ad-container-63417783\" class=\"ad-container js_ad-container\" data-media-type=\"INSTREAM_VIDEO_MOBILE\" data-zone-type=\"INSTREAM_VIDEO_MOBILE\" data-instream-position=\"instream_3\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<p>For example, I can&rsquo;t wait for self-driving cars and car-sharing fleets to become mainstream.

My mom is a teacher and, as with most teachers, gave her heart and soul to the job of teaching her kids. My dad worked for International Trucks for 35 years. I enjoyed a wonderful, relatively easy childhood, but my sister and I learned to work hard for everything we wanted and always did everything we could to be successful.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;Everything we could&rdquo; back then meant we got the best grades we could achieve, tried to be the best at our sport, our instrument, our leadership role in whatever club we led, etc. And twenty-some years ago, that got us into good colleges and eventually steady jobs. That&rsquo;s pretty different than the environment facing today&rsquo;s students, so I feel lucky to have the opportunities I did.</p>\r\n<p>I started working in technology right after graduating from college and after a few years, joined Google as a product manager (PM) just a few months before they IPOed. I was at Google and YouTube for 12 years, working on everything from building Google Apps from the ground up, to running YouTube&rsquo;s EMEA business (which gave me the opportunity to live in Zurich for a few years), to helping launch YouTube Red. I joined Quizlet as CEO in spring of 2016.</p>\r\n<h4><strong>What apps, software, or tools can&rsquo;t you live without?</strong></h4>\r\n<p>I&rsquo;m multiplatform, and work across my personal laptop, work laptop, phone, tablet, home iMac, and kitchen Chromebox (with touchscreen monitor). I live almost entirely &ldquo;in the cloud.&rdquo; I love <a href=\"https://gsuite.google.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">G Suite</a>, but admit my bias having been part of the founding team who built it.

I&rsquo;m into minimalist efficiency, so just my laptop and a power cord plus a small notepad and pen. I have a standing desk. The only things on my desk that aren&rsquo;t work-related are a custom &ldquo;Matthew Glotzbach, Quizlet CEO&rdquo; mug my daughter made me when I got this job, and a desktop putting range for practicing mini-mini-golf (this isn&rsquo;t a real thing).</p>\r\n<h4><strong>What&rsquo;s your best time-saving shortcut or life hack?</strong></h4>\r\n<p>I try to touch things only once (e.g. email, tasks, etc.) and I strive to make efficient use of every minute of my time at work, so that I can be present when I&rsquo;m home with my family. I love to listen to podcasts and audiobooks, but I listen at 1.2-1.5x to be more efficient (depends on the material; too fast and you miss the tone and nuance). I do zero-inbox, and clear out my inbox in the evening before I go to bed.</p>\r\n<h4><strong>What&rsquo;s your favorite to-do list manager?</strong></h4>\r\n<p>I use a combination of <a href=\"https://ticktick.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">TickTick</a> plus pen and paper. I&rsquo;ve been using TickTick as a task list manager across web and mobile devices for years, but I try not to take my phone or computer out during meetings (there&rsquo;s no point in being in a meeting if you aren&rsquo;t paying attention), so I take tasks in my notebook as well. I then either complete the task and check it off in my notebook, or transfer the task to TickTick and &lsquo;X&rsquo; it out of my notebook.</p>\r\n<h4><strong>What everyday thing are you better at than everyone else? What&rsquo;s your secret?</strong></h4>\r\n<p>I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;m better than everyone at anything, but I do think I 1) work really hard and 2) am good at managing many things at once (going back to my midwestern roots, where the value of hard work was instilled in me). I embrace the chaos, and am good at keeping a lot of balls in the air and still being able to focus on details.</p>\r\n<h4><strong>What do you listen to while you work? Got a favorite playlist? Maybe talk radio? Or do you prefer silence?</strong></h4>\r\n<p>I consume a lot of NPR and podcasts (<a href=\"http://www.npr.org/podcasts/381444600/marketplace\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Marketplace with Kai Ryssdal</a>, <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/sections/money/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Planet Money</a>, <a href=\"https://www.entrepreneur.com/topic/masters-of-scale\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Masters of Scale</a>, and more recently <a href=\"https://getcrookedmedia.com/here-have-a-podcast-78ee56b5a323\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Pod Save America</a>) in the morning and evening, and while working out. However, most of the time during the day, I prefer nothing. I find it&rsquo;s hard to focus and listen at the same time.</p>\r\n<h4><strong>What are you currently reading? Or what&rsquo;s something you&rsquo;d recommend?</strong></h4>\r\n<p>I try to read a lot of books, which is a change for me. As a child and early into my career, I wasn&rsquo;t interested in reading books, but over the past decade or so that&rsquo;s changed and I try to read a book every week. I tend to read a lot of non-fiction, work-related books. Some recent books that I enjoyed were:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><a href=\"http://amazon.com/End-Average-Succeed-Values-Sameness-ebook/dp/B00R1JU7P6/?tag=lifehackeramzn-20&amp;ascsubtag=c5c0e18c8008ea83c998c6d2a9f8d44cc8bf6885&amp;rawdata=%5Br%7Chttps%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Ftag%2Fhow-i-work%5Bt%7Clink%5Bp%7C1797606122%5Ba%7CB00R1JU7P6%5Bau%7C1530607028%5Bb%7Clifehacker\" rel=\"nofollow\" data-amazonasin=\"B00R1JU7P6\" data-amazonsubtag=\"[p|1797606122[a|B00R1JU7P6[au|1530607028[b|lifehacker\" data-amazontag=\"lifehackeramzn-20\" data-amazonready=\"true\"><em>The End of Average: How We Succeed in a World That Values Sameness</em></a> by Todd Rose</li>\r\n<li><a href=\"https://amazon.com/Creative-Schools-Grassroots-Revolution-Transforming-ebook/dp/B00OZ0TNOK/?tag=lifehackeramzn-20&amp;ascsubtag=309f14d28d9d6a0af5ff02eb9a483faafefac41b&amp;rawdata=%5Br%7Chttps%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Ftag%2Fhow-i-work%5Bt%7Clink%5Bp%7C1797606122%5Ba%7CB00OZ0TNOK%5Bau%7C1530607028%5Bb%7Clifehacker\" rel=\"nofollow\" data-amazonasin=\"B00OZ0TNOK\" data-amazonsubtag=\"[p|1797606122[a|B00OZ0TNOK[au|1530607028[b|lifehacker\" data-amazontag=\"lifehackeramzn-20\" data-amazonready=\"true\"><em>Creative Schools: The Grassroots Revolution That&rsquo;s Transforming Education</em></a> by Sir Ken Robinson</li>\r\n<li><a href=\"https://amazon.com/Shoe-Dog-Memoir-Creator-Nike-ebook/dp/B0176M1A44/?tag=lifehackeramzn-20&amp;ascsubtag=c239815b1d34f38550694ae9fd0e05b5f0a8f823&amp;rawdata=%5Br%7Chttps%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Ftag%2Fhow-i-work%5Bt%7Clink%5Bp%7C1797606122%5Ba%7CB0176M1A44%5Bau%7C1530607028%5Bb%7Clifehacker\" rel=\"nofollow\" data-amazonasin=\"B0176M1A44\" data-amazonsubtag=\"[p|1797606122[a|B0176M1A44[au|1530607028[b|lifehacker\" data-amazontag=\"lifehackeramzn-20\" data-amazonready=\"true\"><em>Shoe Dog: A Memoir by the Creator of Nike</em></a> by Phil Knight</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>I&rsquo;m also a big fan of the public library. I try to get most of my ebooks and audiobooks from the Menlo Park public library; it&rsquo;s amazing how seamless the library-to-Kindle process is. On a recent trip to the library with my 4th grade daughter, I was explaining to to her how the public library worked and she was blown away that there was such an amazing &ldquo;free&rdquo; resource at our disposal. &ldquo;How does Amazon stay in business?&rdquo; she asked with full sincerity.</p>\r\n<h4><strong>How do you recharge? What do you do when you want to forget about work?</strong></h4>\r\n<p>I love to ride my bike. Exercise clears my head and is good for my soul. I&rsquo;m going to complete two legs of a half Ironman this summer, which I&rsquo;m excited about. Sadly I&rsquo;ve torn my ACLs too many times to run anymore, so I&rsquo;m focused on the swimming and cycling.</p>\r\n<h4><strong>What&rsquo;s your sleep routine like? Are you a night owl or early riser?</strong></h4>\r\n<p>When I was 12, I had a paper route that started at 5am. Since then, I&rsquo;ve been an early riser. I get up at 5:15 every morning and either get a few hours of work done, spend some time reading, or do a workout (a swim or bike ride). I tend to wind down in the evening around 10pm with a little TV or reading and am usually in bed by 10:30 (or 11 at the latest).</p>\r\n<h4><strong>Fill in the blank: I&rsquo;d love to see _________ answer these same questions.</strong></h4>\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.marketplace.org/people/kai-ryssdal\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Kai Ryssdal</a></p>\r\n<h4><strong>What&rsquo;s the best advice you&rsquo;ve ever received?</strong></h4>\r\n<p>Finish what you start.

Instead of replacing your bulbs, Noon Home hopes to improve your lighting by replacing the switches on your walls with smarter wi-fi connected alternatives. For $400, the Noon Smart Lighting Starter Kit includes a master Room Director Switch and two extension switches. That might not seem like a deal, but when you consider that all the bulbs in one room can be controlled by a single switch, this could be a much cheaper option than getting new bulbs for every fixture in your house.</p>\r\n<figure class=\"js_marquee-assetfigure align--left\" style=\"width: 1600px;\">\r\n<div class=\"img-wrapper lazy-image \" style=\"max-width: 1600px;\">\r\n<div class=\"img-wrapper lazy-image \" style=\"max-width: 1600px;\">\r\n<div class=\"img-permalink-sub-wrapper img-permalink-sub-wrapper--nobackground\" style=\"padding-bottom: 56.3%;\"><span class=\"js_lightbox-wrapper lightbox-wrapper\"><img class=\"ls-lazy-image-tag cursor-pointer lazyautosizes lazyloaded\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" data-sizes=\"auto\" data-width=\"1600\" data-chomp-id=\"vacdayhvvo2enhoycfbp\" data-format=\"jpg\" /></span></div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<figcaption>These are the core pieces of the switch that gets installed in your wall.</figcaption>\r\n</figure>\r\n<p>The obvious caveat is that this process involves ripping out your existing switches, face plates and electrical boxes and installing new ones (goodbye deposit). That&rsquo;s just a little bit more of a commitment than screwing in a few lightbulbs. But at least if you go the DIY route, you won&rsquo;t have to pay someone else to do it. If you&rsquo;re simply not the handy type, Noon says it is partnering with <a href=\"http://www.installernet.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">InstallerNet</a>, a service that connects installers with customers for a fee, to connect home-owners with professionals who should be able to get the job done.</p>\r\n<p>The real magic should happen once the smart switches are installed. Noon claims its bulb discovery tech can automatically detect the types of bulbs you are using so that you can use Noon&rsquo;s mobile app to group various fixtures together, create different lighting scenes and adjust their brightness, all while minimizing the flickering and popping you often get from old-school dumb bulbs. No more dimmers or trying to remember if your new bulbs are the same wattage as your old ones, Noon should do it for you.</p>\r\n<p>Noon&rsquo;s app can also learn from your behavior, so that when you go on a trip, you can activate Vacation Mode and have the system turn on lights to mimic how things would look if you were actually at home. And like seemingly every other piece of smart tech in 2017, Noon&rsquo;s system supports voice controls via Amazon Alexa.</p>\r\n<figure class=\"js_marquee-assetfigure align--bleed\">\r\n<div class=\"img-wrapper lazy-image \" style=\"max-width: 1600px;\">\r\n<div class=\"img-wrapper lazy-image \" style=\"max-width: 1600px;\">\r\n<div class=\"img-permalink-sub-wrapper img-permalink-sub-wrapper--nobackground\" style=\"padding-bottom: 56.3%;\"><span class=\"js_lightbox-wrapper lightbox-wrapper\"><img class=\"ls-lazy-image-tag cursor-pointer lazyautosizes lazyloaded\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" data-sizes=\"auto\" data-width=\"1600\" data-chomp-id=\"hmzaylgoxikyg4tizkpt\" data-format=\"jpg\" /></span></div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<figcaption>After installing the switches, Noon&rsquo;s app (available on iOS and Android) runs through a quick tutorial so that it can identify each bulb and what fixture its in.</figcaption>\r\n</figure>\r\n<p>The primary Room Director switch, which functions as a master control of sorts, also sports a built-in LCD screen that allows users to switch lighting scenes just by swiping left or right on the display. It also features a motion detector, which can be used to activate Night Light mode whenever you walk by&mdash;handy for those late night trips to the bathroom.</p>\r\n<p>When I tried the whole system out installed at an apartment in New York, switching between various lighting setups and brightness took just a couple swipes and a tap, and the smartphone app actually seemed a bit more well-rounded compared to something like the Phillips Hue app. However, I found myself wanting to have a more than just a single Room Director, even in the small test apartment, so I could have the motion detection cover a larger portion of the living space. The problem is that the Room Director&rsquo;s $200 price tag really forces you to decide how many you actually need. Noon says one Director per floor should be more than enough for most homes, but I&rsquo;m not sure if it would be enough for me.</p>\r\n<figure class=\"js_marquee-assetfigure align--bleed\">\r\n<div class=\"img-wrapper lazy-image \" style=\"max-width: 1600px;\">\r\n<div class=\"img-permalink-sub-wrapper img-permalink-sub-wrapper--nobackground\" style=\"padding-bottom: 56.3%;\"><span class=\"js_lightbox-wrapper lightbox-wrapper\"><img class=\"ls-lazy-image-tag cursor-pointer lazyautosizes lazyloaded\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" data-sizes=\"auto\" data-width=\"1600\" data-chomp-id=\"xk1myfetb1oglmxlfvwe\" data-format=\"jpg\" /></span></div>\r\n</div>\r\n</figure>\r\n<p>If you&rsquo;ve done the math and Noon seems cheaper than a smart bulb solution than Noon&rsquo;s switches will be available online and from major retailers including Best Buy and Home Depot.

Microsoft is finally ready to compete in the smart speaker market after unveiling its Cortana-powered version of the Amazon Echo <a href=\"https://gizmodo.com/microsoft-screams-me-too-with-cortana-powered-rival-to-1795013201\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">earlier this year</a>. The <a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/cortana/devices/invoke\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Harman Kardon Invoke</a> launched on Sunday with high-quality audio and a stylish design for $199.</p>\r\n<div class=\"ad-container js_ad-video row ad-wide ad-top js_ad-video-desktop\">\r\n<div class=\"ad-instream ad-instream--elastic instream-permalink ad-instream__initial\">\r\n<div class=\"elastic__wrapper\">\r\n<div class=\"ad-unit js_ad-unit ad-video js_ad-video\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<p>But how does it compare to the competition from Amazon, Google, Apple and Sonos? Let&rsquo;s find out.</p>\r\n<h3>Microsoft&rsquo;s Harman Kardon Invoke ($199)</h3>\r\n<p>Here&rsquo;s what you need to know about the newest smart speaker in an increasingly crowded market.</p>\r\n<h4>What It Has</h4>\r\n<figure class=\"js_marquee-assetfigure align--left\" style=\"width: 398px;\">\r\n<div class=\"img-wrapper lazy-image \" style=\"max-width: 398px;\">\r\n<div class=\"img-permalink-sub-wrapper img-permalink-sub-wrapper--nobackground\" style=\"padding-bottom: 124.6%;\"><span class=\"js_lightbox-wrapper lightbox-wrapper\"><img class=\"ls-lazy-image-tag cursor-pointer lazyautosizes lazyloaded\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" data-sizes=\"auto\" data-width=\"398\" data-chomp-id=\"ijbwucj9hbfw8gwzmtsm\" data-format=\"png\" /></span></div>\r\n</div>\r\n</figure>\r\n<p>The Invoke&rsquo;s biggest perk is audio quality, thanks to three 1.75-inch midrange drivers and three 0.5-inch tweeters that provide 360-degree sound. It&rsquo;s missing a subwoofer, but makes up for it with a passive radiator for bass. In their review, <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2017/10/20/16505468/harman-kardon-invoke-cortana-microsoft-smart-speaker-review\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">The Verge</a> notes that it sounds better than the Amazon Echo and Google Home, but not as good as the Sonos One. Apple claims its HomePod speaker will also offer superior sound quality, but we won&rsquo;t know for sure until it actually launches later this year.</p>\r\n<p>Microsoft&rsquo;s new speaker also boasts a pretty nice design. It&rsquo;s similar to the cylindrical Echo, but tapers in at the top with a metal speaker grille that covers most of the body. It also has touch controls up top, including the option to pause the music by simply tapping on the device. Plus, there&rsquo;s an aux port if you want to connect it to a more powerful speaker, along with Bluetooth support.</p>\r\n<p>As for Cortana, Microsoft&rsquo;s AI assistant works pretty well according to The Verge, but can&rsquo;t really compete with more refined services from Google and Amazon. Hopefully that will improve with future software updates.</p>\r\n<figure class=\"js_marquee-assetfigure align--bleed\">\r\n<div class=\"img-wrapper lazy-image \" style=\"max-width: 1400px;\">\r\n<div class=\"img-permalink-sub-wrapper img-permalink-sub-wrapper--nobackground\" style=\"padding-bottom: 43.9%;\"><span class=\"js_lightbox-wrapper lightbox-wrapper\"><img class=\"ls-lazy-image-tag cursor-pointer lazyautosizes lazyloaded\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" data-sizes=\"auto\" data-width=\"1400\" data-chomp-id=\"eqv83rxggem6qekgw46k\" data-format=\"jpg\" /></span></div>\r\n</div>\r\n</figure>\r\n<h4>What It Doesn&rsquo;t Have</h4>\r\n<p>Cortana also comes with some drawbacks that could make you think twice about buying the Invoke. It only really works with Microsoft apps for features like checking your calendar or getting reminders. The Invoke also limits you to just one account (at least for now), so multiple family members or roommates can&rsquo;t check their calendars on the same speaker.</p>\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2017/10/20/16505468/harman-kardon-invoke-cortana-microsoft-smart-speaker-review\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">The Verge notes </a>in their review that call quality on the Invoke was pretty poor on both ends. The speaker also only supports Skype calls for now, and you can&rsquo;t even use it to make a call from your phone over Bluetooth.</p>\r\n<p>The Invoke doesn&rsquo;t come at a discount, either. At $199, it&rsquo;s way more expensive than the flagship Echo ($99) and the Google Home ($129). It&rsquo;s still cheaper than the HomePod ($349) but it&rsquo;s the same price as the Sonos One, which runs Amazon&rsquo;s Alexa AI.</p>\r\n<h4>Who Should Buy It?</h4>\r\n<p>If you&rsquo;re an audiophile who&rsquo;s already bought into Microsoft&rsquo;s ecosystem of apps, this is the speaker for you. Otherwise, there are cheaper options from Amazon and Google&mdash;or better audio quality for the same price from Sonos.</p>\r\n<h3>Sonos One ($199)</h3>\r\n<figure class=\"js_marquee-assetfigure align--bleed\">\r\n<div class=\"img-wrapper lazy-image \" style=\"max-width: 800px;\">\r\n<div class=\"img-wrapper lazy-image \" style=\"max-width: 800px;\">\r\n<div class=\"img-permalink-sub-wrapper img-permalink-sub-wrapper--nobackground\" style=\"padding-bottom: 56.3%;\"><span class=\"js_lightbox-wrapper lightbox-wrapper\"><img class=\"ls-lazy-image-tag cursor-pointer lazyautosizes lazyloaded\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" data-sizes=\"auto\" data-width=\"800\" data-chomp-id=\"qgapcturkgnojuasqk3d\" data-format=\"jpg\" /></span></div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<figcaption>Gizmodo</figcaption>\r\n</figure>\r\n<p>Speaking of Sonos, here&rsquo;s a bit more on the company&rsquo;s first smart speaker: the $199 <a href=\"https://gizmodo.com/sonos-finally-squished-alexa-into-a-speaker-but-maybe-1819617682#_ga=2.62033774.398743399.1508261117-1167719708.1504278915\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Sonos One</a>.</p>\r\n<h4>What It Has</h4>\r\n<p>Like the Invoke, the Sonos One boasts great audio, which shouldn&rsquo;t come as a surprise from a company known for making speakers. The design is also appealing and includes a physical button for turning off the built-in microphone, though it&rsquo;s a little boxier than Microsoft&rsquo;s model.</p>\r\n<div class=\"ad-container js_ad-video row ad-wide ad-top js_ad-video-mobile\">\r\n<div class=\"ad-instream ad-instream--elastic instream-permalink ad-instream__initial\">\r\n<div class=\"elastic__wrapper\">\r\n<div class=\"ad-unit js_ad-unit ad-video js_ad-video\">\r\n<div id=\"ad-container-95842640\" class=\"ad-container js_ad-container\" data-media-type=\"INSTREAM_VIDEO_MOBILE\" data-zone-type=\"INSTREAM_VIDEO_MOBILE\" data-instream-position=\"instream_3\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<p>The Sonos One should also get some great software features down the road, including support for Google Assistant (it currently only works with Amazon&rsquo;s Alexa AI), but for now the software is actually pretty limited.</p>\r\n<h4>What It Doesn&rsquo;t Have</h4>\r\n<p>Out of the box, the Sonos One is a bit of a letdown as a smart speaker. Alexa isn&rsquo;t even enabled by default, and setting it up is a multi-step process that involves syncing your Amazon and Sonos accounts. <a href=\"https://gizmodo.com/sonos-finally-squished-alexa-into-a-speaker-but-maybe-1819617682#_ga=2.39128166.494867739.1508187806-1313785359.1499701416\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Gizmodo</a> also notes that it doesn&rsquo;t yet support standard Alexa features like voice calls, sending text messages and setting reminders, though Sonos says they&rsquo;ll come in a future update.</p>\r\n<h4>Who Should Buy It?</h4>\r\n<p>Audiophiles looking for a standalone smart speaker with great sound should consider the Sonos One. But if you already have a solid speaker, you might be better off hooking it up to a cheaper option like the <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/amazon-split-the-echo-in-half-to-create-two-new-alexa-d-1762620816\" rel=\"nofollow\">Echo Dot</a> or <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/should-you-buy-a-new-google-home-speaker-1819148716\" rel=\"nofollow\">Google Mini</a>.</p>\r\n<h3>Amazon Echo ($99)</h3>\r\n<figure class=\"js_marquee-assetfigure align--bleed\">\r\n<div class=\"img-wrapper lazy-image \" style=\"max-width: 800px;\">\r\n<div class=\"img-wrapper lazy-image \" style=\"max-width: 800px;\">\r\n<div class=\"img-permalink-sub-wrapper img-permalink-sub-wrapper--nobackground\" style=\"padding-bottom: 56.3%;\"><span class=\"js_lightbox-wrapper lightbox-wrapper\"><img class=\"ls-lazy-image-tag cursor-pointer lazyautosizes lazyloaded\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" data-sizes=\"auto\" data-width=\"800\" data-chomp-id=\"e5gceau0cfqzalqpyxho\" data-format=\"jpg\" /></span></div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<figcaption><a href=\"https://gizmodo.com/after-almost-3-years-theres-a-new-echo-1818846014\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Gizmodo</a></figcaption>\r\n</figure>\r\n<p>Amazon keeps adding new devices to its smart speaker lineup, but the Echo is still the gold standard. Here&rsquo;s how the 2017 model compares to the competition.</p>\r\n<h4>What It Has</h4>\r\n<p>The biggest improvement to the new Echo is its far-field microphones, which were redesigned for better voice recognition. That should make it even easier to talk to Alexa. Amazon also redesigned the exterior, with a squatter shape and variety of covers in fabrics or wood so it blends into the decoration.</p>\r\n<p>Alexa has become the industry standard for smart home speakers, so it supports the most skills and gadgets. Amazon also added the ability to sync multiple Echos together for a wireless system, and it&rsquo;s selling three of the $100 speakers for just $250 when you buy them together.</p>\r\n<aside class=\"inset--story js_inset branded-item branded-item--lifehacker\">\r\n<figure><img class=\"lazyautosizes lazyloaded\" src=\"https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/s--sywTJbDU--/c_fill,fl_progressive,g_north,h_77,q_80,w_137/i7gdashi4lxoy3q8jxze.jpg\" alt=\"Article preview thumbnail\" data-sizes=\"auto\" /></figure>\r\n<div class=\"inset--story__content\">\r\n<h6 class=\"inset--story__headline\"><a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/the-alexa-skills-that-are-actually-worth-using-1791616099\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">The Best Alexa Skills to Add to Your Amazon Echo</a></h6>\r\n<p>You can add tons of features to your Amazon Echo with little apps Amazon calls &ldquo;Alexa Skills.&rdquo; Most &hellip;</p>\r\n<a class=\"js_readmore inset--story__readmore\" href=\"https://lifehacker.com/the-alexa-skills-that-are-actually-worth-using-1791616099\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Read more </a></div>\r\n</aside>\r\n<h4>What It Doesn&rsquo;t Have</h4>\r\n<p>The Echo is limited to what Alexa can do, but that shouldn&rsquo;t be an issue in most cases. It is missing a few features offered by more expensive Amazon devices like the Echo Plus ($150), which packs a built-in smart home hub in case the smart home gadgets you buy don&rsquo;t work directly with the Echo. There&rsquo;s also the Echo Show ($229) with its built-in touchscreen, but you&rsquo;re not going to get any of that from the competition, anyway.</p>\r\n<h4>Who Should Buy It?</h4>\r\n<p>If you&rsquo;re looking for a simple standalone smart speaker with okay sound, this is the way to go. If you&rsquo;ve already bought into Google, Microsoft or Apple&rsquo;s ecosystems, then it&rsquo;s worth considering their respective options, and if you want something extra, try one of Amazon&rsquo;s fancier models.</p>\r\n<h3>Google Home ($129)</h3>\r\n<figure class=\"js_marquee-assetfigure align--bleed\">\r\n<div class=\"img-wrapper lazy-image \" style=\"max-width: 1600px;\">\r\n<div class=\"img-wrapper lazy-image \" style=\"max-width: 1600px;\">\r\n<div class=\"img-permalink-sub-wrapper img-permalink-sub-wrapper--nobackground\" style=\"padding-bottom: 56.3%;\"><span class=\"js_lightbox-wrapper lightbox-wrapper\"><img class=\"ls-lazy-image-tag cursor-pointer lazyautosizes lazyloaded\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" data-sizes=\"auto\" data-width=\"1600\" data-chomp-id=\"xnqlcjd6e6lh3p7mveqf\" data-format=\"jpg\" /></span></div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<figcaption>Gizmodo</figcaption>\r\n</figure>\r\n<p>Google&rsquo;s answer to the Amazon Echo offers some great features thanks to Google Assistant.

Google Assistant is better at parsing natural language, and it understands context, so you can ask a follow-up question without repeating yourself.</p>\r\n<p>Google Home also works with Chromecast. So you can tell it to play a video and it will stream on any TV in the house with an attached dongle or built in Cast support. The same goes for any speaker with support for <a href=\"https://gizmodo.com/google-cast-for-audio-can-googles-airplay-answer-be-mo-1677348050\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Google Cast audio</a>.</p>\r\n<p>The design is fun and playful with swappable bases in different colors and fabrics, even if it looks a bit like an air freshener.</p>\r\n<aside class=\"inset--story js_inset branded-item branded-item--lifehacker\">\r\n<figure><img class=\"lazyautosizes lazyloaded\" src=\"https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/s--ItPT-5PQ--/c_fill,fl_progressive,g_north,h_77,q_80,w_137/dinkdrgunnyhfgb4xgab.jpg\" alt=\"Article preview thumbnail\" data-sizes=\"auto\" /></figure>\r\n<div class=\"inset--story__content\">\r\n<h6 class=\"inset--story__headline\"><a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/the-best-google-assistant-skills-to-use-with-your-googl-1792134538\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">The Best Google Assistant Skills to Use With Your Google Home</a></h6>\r\n<p>Google may be playing catch up with the Amazon Echo, but Google Home already has a bunch of&hellip;</p>\r\n<a class=\"js_readmore inset--story__readmore\" href=\"https://lifehacker.com/the-best-google-assistant-skills-to-use-with-your-googl-1792134538\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Read more </a></div>\r\n</aside>\r\n<h4>What It Doesn&rsquo;t Have</h4>\r\n<p>Google Home does have some software limits on what it can do, though Google has reliably continued updating it with new skills and features.

Apple&rsquo;s long-awaited answer to the Echo won&rsquo;t launch until December, so we don&rsquo;t know exactly how well it will perform. Here&rsquo;s what we do know about the upcoming smart speaker.</p>\r\n<h4>What it Has</h4>\r\n<p>Apple put a big emphasis on audio quality when it revealed the HomePod earlier this year. The speaker features seven tweeters, &ldquo;precision acoustic horns&rdquo; and a subwoofer. <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2017/6/5/15743886/homepod-audio-quality-demo-echo-sonos-bass\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">The Verge </a>actually tested one back in June in a very controlled demo with specifically chosen songs, and said it sounds great, but quality may vary in real world use.</p>\r\n<p>The HomePod also packs in six microphones for picking up your voice, so hopefully it won&rsquo;t have any trouble recognizing commands. Though, again, no one&rsquo;s been able to test that out in the wild yet.</p>\r\n<h4>What It Doesn&rsquo;t Have</h4>\r\n<p>The fact that the HomePod relies on Siri is a little worrisome; Apple&rsquo;s AI still lags behind the competition, even if the company says its working on a Siri-specific update for the speaker.</p>\r\n<p>As for the design, it&rsquo;s fine but not particularly appealing and comes in black or white. The $350 price tag may also scare some people away, but that&rsquo;s the <a href=\"https://gizmodo.com/5065133/the-truth-about-the-apple-tax\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Apple tax</a> for you.</p>\r\n<h4>Should You Buy It?</h4>\r\n<p>If you&rsquo;re totally bought into Apple&rsquo;s ecosystem, the HomePod is the smart speaker for you. Otherwise, you&rsquo;re probably better off with something else, though it&rsquo;s possible Apple will prove us wrong when the HomePod finally launches.</p>', 'blogimage/hpkcfa9nongpdlh11ogh.jpg', 1, '2017-10-30 19:04:47', '2017-10-30 19:04:47', NULL),

It offers near-instant access to Google Assistant, making it easy to ask what&rsquo;s on your calendar today or how bad the traffic will be on the way to work. You can yell Google searches, like &ldquo;When was the last time the United States missed the World Cup?&rdquo; (<a href=\"https://deadspin.com/u-s-a-out-of-world-cup-on-phantom-goal-1819343176\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Until this year</a>, it was 1986.) And perhaps most usefully, you can control the connected devices in your home with the Google Home Mini. You could say, &ldquo;Hey Google, turn on the TV.&rdquo; And it would happen like magic.</p>\r\n<aside class=\"reviewbox-inset align--left\">\r\n<section class=\"review-box\">\r\n<div class=\"storytype-label-wrapper storytype-label-wrapper--small-margin\"><a class=\"storytype-label storytype-label--outlined\" href=\"https://gizmodo.com/c/review/smart-home\">Smart Home</a><a class=\"storytype-label storytype-label--outlined\" href=\"https://gizmodo.com/c/review/smart-home/google\">Google</a></div>\r\n<div class=\"review-box__image-wrapper\">\r\n<div class=\"review-box__image-container\"><img src=\"https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/s--m9yH5bTw--/c_fill,fl_progressive,g_center,h_264,q_80,w_470/ahoo5aea25ne3u2ifm8d.jpg\" alt=\"Lead\" /></div>\r\n</div>\r\n<div class=\"review-box__content\">\r\n<h1 class=\"review-box__title\">Google Home Mini</h1>\r\n<div class=\"review-box__data-item\">\r\n<h2 class=\"review-box__data-label\">What is it?</h2>\r\n<p class=\"review-box__data-value\">A pretty little smart speaker</p>\r\n</div>\r\n<div class=\"review-box__data-item\">\r\n<h2 class=\"review-box__data-label\">Price</h2>\r\n<p class=\"review-box__data-value\">$50</p>\r\n</div>\r\n<div class=\"review-box__data-item\">\r\n<h2 class=\"review-box__data-label\">Like</h2>\r\n<p class=\"review-box__data-value\">Beautiful hardware design, great software design</p>\r\n</div>\r\n<div class=\"review-box__data-item\">\r\n<h2 class=\"review-box__data-label\">No Like</h2>\r\n<p class=\"review-box__data-value\">No headphone jack</p>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</section>\r\n</aside>\r\n<p>The original Google Home is a solid competitor to the Amazon Echo, a device I&rsquo;d describe as the gold standard of voice-powered home-control devices. The Google Home Mini is an obvious competitor to the Amazon Echo Dot, a device that looks like a can of chewing tobacco and offers a lot of the same capabilities as grandaddy Echo. Both devices cost about $50. Both are small.</p>\r\n<p>The big difference is that the Google Home Mini is a handsome little thing. The device actually looks nice, like an eccentric decoration that connects to the internet and does things. You&rsquo;d almost never know it was there, either, because the fabric-covered device (available in chalk, charcoal, and coral colors) practically disappears on your countertop.</p>\r\n<p>The hardware design is simple&mdash;almost too simple. There are four indicator lights on the top of the little wafer and a single speaker inside. The device is also touch sensitive. You can adjust the volume by tapping on the sides and play or pause music by tapping the top. (<strong><em>UPDATE:</em>&nbsp;</strong>Google <a href=\"http://www.androidpolice.com/2017/10/11/google-permanently-removes-top-touch-functionality-home-mini/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">has permanently disabled</a> all touch functionality on the top of the Home Mini, after a blogger spotted a bug that recorded all audio after using that functionality. You can still adjust the volume by touching the sides, however.) The only semblance of a physical button is a small switch on the bottom to mute the far-field microphone. That microphone is pretty good but not amazing. It will pick up your voice from across the room, but not if there&rsquo;s a lot of noise in the background.</p>\r\n<figure class=\"js_marquee-assetfigure align--bleed\">\r\n<div class=\"img-wrapper lazy-image \" style=\"max-width: 4944px;\">\r\n<div class=\"img-wrapper lazy-image \" style=\"max-width: 4944px;\">\r\n<div class=\"img-permalink-sub-wrapper img-permalink-sub-wrapper--nobackground\" style=\"padding-bottom: 56.3%;\"><span class=\"js_lightbox-wrapper lightbox-wrapper\"><img class=\"ls-lazy-image-tag cursor-pointer lazyautosizes lazyloaded\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" data-sizes=\"auto\" data-width=\"4944\" data-chomp-id=\"xbzfhk8fxtfdzloghmvf\" data-format=\"jpg\" /></span></div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<figcaption>The mute switch for the microphone is handy but easily hidden from view.</figcaption>\r\n</figure>\r\n<p>The speaker itself is also pretty good but definitely not amazing. Then again, the Google Home Mini is not meant to be a home audio system. That&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://gizmodo.com/home-max-google-goes-after-homepod-with-a-big-ass-sono-1819143218\" rel=\"nofollow\">what the Google Home Max is for</a>. There is also no input for a 3.5-millimeter audio cable, which frankly sucks since you can&rsquo;t connect a bigger speaker directly to the Google Home Mini. You&rsquo;ll need Chromecast Audio to do that. It&rsquo;s also worth noting that Google Home will not work with Sonos Play:1 or Sonos Play:3 speakers <a href=\"http://www.smh.com.au/technology/gadgets-on-the-go/google-and-sonos-spark-smart-home-turf-war-20171009-gyx0hz.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">at all</a>. You can connect a Sonos Play:5 speaker using Chromecast Audio.</p>\r\n<p>On the software end of things, the Google Home Mini also excels. Set up takes approximately six seconds with the Google Home app&mdash;which you won&rsquo;t really need to use afterwards since you program all of the actions with the separate Google Assistant app. Here, you can link your Assistant to third party services like Spotify or to home control systems like Logitech Harmony or Philips Hue. You can also program so-called shortcuts that makes interacting with the Assistant more natural. So, for example, you don&rsquo;t have to say, &ldquo;Hey Google, turn on the Philips Hue lights.&rdquo; You can just say, &ldquo;Hey Google, turn on the lights.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<figure class=\"js_marquee-assetfigure align--bleed\">\r\n<div class=\"img-wrapper lazy-image \" style=\"max-width: 5472px;\">\r\n<div class=\"img-wrapper lazy-image \" style=\"max-width: 5472px;\">\r\n<div class=\"img-permalink-sub-wrapper img-permalink-sub-wrapper--nobackground\" style=\"padding-bottom: 56.3%;\"><span class=\"js_lightbox-wrapper lightbox-wrapper\"><img class=\"ls-lazy-image-tag cursor-pointer lazyautosizes lazyloaded\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" data-sizes=\"auto\" data-width=\"5472\" data-chomp-id=\"zjrzmlduj5uxp7dryhlr\" data-format=\"jpg\" /></span></div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<figcaption>Google compares the shape to a donut, but it feels like a cheeseburger slider to me.</figcaption>\r\n</figure>\r\n<p>The Google Assistant and Google Home experience feels intuitive, and it should. Google has a ton of experience when it comes to natural language processing and machine learning as well as software that involves voice control, thanks to decades of building out its search capabilities. The ability to easily customize your experience also harkens back to Google&rsquo;s experience building a flexible platform like Android. The Amazon approach is much less flexible. Compared to the Amazon Echo&mdash;a bumpy boat ride that gets you to your destination&mdash;the Google Home experience feels like a luxury cruise. But even luxury cruises can be flawed, weird, and unsatisfying at times.</p>\r\n<div class=\"ad-container js_ad-video row ad-wide ad-top js_ad-video-mobile\">\r\n<div class=\"ad-instream ad-instream--elastic instream-permalink ad-instream__initial\">\r\n<div class=\"elastic__wrapper\">\r\n<div class=\"ad-unit js_ad-unit ad-video js_ad-video\">\r\n<div id=\"ad-container-64410400\" class=\"ad-container js_ad-container\" data-media-type=\"INSTREAM_VIDEO_MOBILE\" data-zone-type=\"INSTREAM_VIDEO_MOBILE\" data-instream-position=\"instream_3\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<p>The vast majority of my time with the Google Home Mini has been functional and fun. It&rsquo;s great to find a YouTube video on my phone, turn on my TV with a voice command, and cast the video on the bigger screen. This seemingly simple action&mdash;and many others&mdash;work best if you do everything in the Google ecosystem. For instance, if you don&rsquo;t have a home control system already set up, you need <a href=\"https://support.google.com/googlehome/answer/7498991?hl=en\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">a Chromecast that&rsquo;s plugged directly into the wall</a> to turn on your TV with Google Home. I have the Logitech Harmony system, so I routed the Google Assistant actions through that to turn on the TV. In doing so, I set up a shortcut in the Assistant app that saved me from telling my Google Home to tell Harmony to turn on the TV. I just have to say, &ldquo;Turn on the TV.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<figure class=\"js_marquee-assetfigure align--bleed\">\r\n<div class=\"img-wrapper lazy-image \" style=\"max-width: 4879px;\">\r\n<div class=\"img-wrapper lazy-image \" style=\"max-width: 4879px;\">\r\n<div class=\"img-permalink-sub-wrapper img-permalink-sub-wrapper--nobackground\" style=\"padding-bottom: 56.2%;\"><span class=\"js_lightbox-wrapper lightbox-wrapper\"><img class=\"ls-lazy-image-tag cursor-pointer lazyautosizes lazyloaded\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" data-sizes=\"auto\" data-width=\"4879\" data-chomp-id=\"zlbpqdqkgv0phsbjeygv\" data-format=\"jpg\" /></span></div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<figcaption>Which one would you rather have in your kitchen?</figcaption>\r\n</figure>\r\n<p>It&rsquo;s worth highlighting that Google Assistant does struggle a bit with added layers of complexity. My lighting setup is slightly unusual, since I use Philips Hue bulbs in three lamps, one of which is plugged into an internet-connected Lutron switch. I like the switch because it comes with a little remote I can use to dim the lamp without getting out of bed or touching my phone. Google Assistant struggles with this setup. Basic commands like, &ldquo;Brighten the lights,&rdquo; work, but every time, the Google Home Mini would remind me that it doesn&rsquo;t know what to do with the lamp that&rsquo;s plugged into the Lutron switch. Attempting to turn on specific scenes, like the Philips Hue nightlight, doesn&rsquo;t work at all. It&rsquo;s possible some tinkering might solve this problem, and because the Assistant app is so easy to use, I won&rsquo;t even mind doing it.</p>\r\n<p>This example might be specific to me, but it illustrates how using Google Assistant to control home devices still lacks some sophistication. The problem could be easily solved if Google added some hardware to Home devices and turned them into smart home hubs. Apple did this with the HomePod, as did Amazon <a href=\"https://gizmodo.com/after-almost-3-years-theres-a-new-echo-1818846014#_ga=2.43276710.2055133709.1507747755-1764601981.1503686132\" rel=\"nofollow\">with the Echo Plus</a>. It remains to be seen how much this will improve the user experience and customization options, however, because neither of these products will ship until later this year. In the meantime, you can connect the Google Home Mini to a hub&mdash;in my case, it was a Harmony Hub&mdash;and gain some new functionality. It might not work 100 percent of the time! That&rsquo;s kinda part of the fun, though.</p>\r\n<figure class=\"js_marquee-assetfigure align--bleed\">\r\n<div class=\"img-wrapper lazy-image \" style=\"max-width: 3863px;\">\r\n<div class=\"img-permalink-sub-wrapper img-permalink-sub-wrapper--nobackground\" style=\"padding-bottom: 56.3%;\"><span class=\"js_lightbox-wrapper lightbox-wrapper\"><img class=\"ls-lazy-image-tag cursor-pointer lazyautosizes lazyloaded\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" data-sizes=\"auto\" data-width=\"3863\" data-chomp-id=\"eaeqtqrskzjzdd5aovop\" data-format=\"jpg\" /></span></div>\r\n</div>\r\n</figure>\r\n<p>In the end, the Google Home Mini is just that: fun. It&rsquo;s fun to set up. It&rsquo;s fun to use. It&rsquo;s even fun figuring out what the device can do that you haven&rsquo;t already thought of. And while you can do similar things with any Amazon Echo device, the experience feels less personal. Maybe that&rsquo;s the ugly hardware or clunky software imbuing me with a negative feeling, but I just don&rsquo;t enjoy the Echo as much as I enjoy the Home.</p>\r\n<p>The best part about this whole equation is that $50 price tag. That makes it easy to buy multiple Google Home Minis and put them in multiple rooms. The little smart speaker might even add a little design flair, too, since they&rsquo;re so damn good-looking. (You absolutely cannot say the same for the Amazon Echo Dot.) What I believe is even more attractive is the idea that you can experiment with the idea of having a well designed smart speaker and then not feel awful if you don&rsquo;t end up using it. For the price of a decent dinner for two, the Google Home Mini is a conversation piece at worst. At best, it&rsquo;s your new best friend.</p>', 'blogimage/fmf9e1ggkfcsx5ypdgno.jpg', 1, '2017-10-30 19:06:25', '2017-10-30 19:06:25', NULL),

This round little innovation knocked people&rsquo;s socks off when it came out in 2011, in part, because few people had ever contemplated the promise of a regular old household gadget that connected to the internet and could be controlled with a smartphone. And nobody had ever seen such a nice-looking thermostat, either.</p>\r\n<p>The new &ldquo;E-is-for-everybody&rdquo; edition almost looks like a different gadget. The dark glossy face has been replaced with a frosted white situation that&rsquo;s designed to blend in with your home. The formerly silver ring around the edge is also white now, and all the colors are nice and soft, almost like pastels. You&rsquo;re supposed to notice a big difference in how the new thermostat displays information. The front glass has a matte film on the inside, so that the digital display doesn&rsquo;t look so much like a computer screen. In the words of Nest&rsquo;s head designer Sung Bai, it feels &ldquo;like watercolor.&rdquo; When the display is off, the Nest Thermostat E is just a white dot on the wall.</p>\r\n<figure class=\"js_marquee-assetfigure align--bleed\">\r\n<div class=\"img-wrapper lazy-image \" style=\"max-width: 2000px;\">\r\n<div class=\"img-permalink-sub-wrapper img-permalink-sub-wrapper--nobackground\" style=\"padding-bottom: 56.3%;\"><span class=\"js_lightbox-wrapper lightbox-wrapper\"><img class=\"ls-lazy-image-tag cursor-pointer lazyautosizes lazyloaded\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" data-sizes=\"auto\" data-width=\"2000\" data-chomp-id=\"zi5m3qytfkwimreawqpw\" data-format=\"jpg\" /></span></div>\r\n</div>\r\n</figure>\r\n<p>The aesthetic adjustment makes good sense for Nest. As other smarthome companies have played catch up and released fancy thermometers of their own, Nest has lost some of the cachet that made it turn heads back in 2011. Nest did buy DropCam <a href=\"http://gizmodo.com/say-hello-to-cam-and-aware-nests-very-own-home-surveil-1712007026\" rel=\"nofollow\">for half a billion dollars</a> a couple years ago, but security cameras aren&rsquo;t quite the cool factor the company needs. Whether an all-white design with a curious frosted glass display will fill that need remains to be seen.</p>\r\n<p>In addition to the new design, the Nest Thermostat E comes with a pre-set schedule to save energy so you don&rsquo;t have to worry about a custom setup if you don&rsquo;t want to. And honestly that&rsquo;s it. The new Nest, a lot like the old Nest but prettier.

Philips&rsquo; Hue line, one of the first smart lighting systems available, uses bulbs that look and work just like standard incandescents, with the added convenience that you can remotely control them all from a mobile app. The only catch is that Philips&rsquo; system requires a wi-fi network in your home, a base station connected to your router, and yet another adapter squeezed onto your already crowded power bar.</p>\r\n<div class=\"ad-container js_ad-video row ad-wide ad-top js_ad-video-desktop\">\r\n<div class=\"ad-instream ad-instream--elastic instream-permalink ad-instream__initial\">\r\n<div class=\"elastic__wrapper\">\r\n<div class=\"ad-unit js_ad-unit ad-video js_ad-video\">\r\n<div id=\"ad-container-17812612\" class=\"ad-container js_ad-container\" data-media-type=\"INSTREAM_VIDEO\" data-zone-type=\"INSTREAM_VIDEO\" data-instream-position=\"instream_3\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<p>But there&rsquo;s a much easier solution now, as long as you&rsquo;ve completely bought into the Apple ecosystem. Installing Sylvania&rsquo;s new Smart+ A19 full-color LED bulb is as easy as changing any of the bulbs in your house, because instead of talking to a base station, they talk directly to your iPhone or iPad using a built-in Bluetooth radio, and piggyback on the HomeKit smart home infrastructure Apple introduced to its mobile operating system a few years ago.</p>\r\n<figure class=\"js_marquee-assetfigure align--left\" style=\"width: 970px;\">\r\n<div class=\"img-wrapper lazy-image \" style=\"max-width: 970px;\">\r\n<div class=\"img-wrapper lazy-image \" style=\"max-width: 970px;\">\r\n<div class=\"img-permalink-sub-wrapper img-permalink-sub-wrapper--nobackground\" style=\"padding-bottom: 56.3%;\"><span class=\"js_lightbox-wrapper lightbox-wrapper\"><img class=\"ls-lazy-image-tag cursor-pointer lazyautosizes lazyloaded\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" data-sizes=\"auto\" data-width=\"970\" data-chomp-id=\"jt4yhyqcz3gxi9dqs6a9\" data-format=\"jpg\" /></span></div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<figcaption>Don&rsquo;t worry, if you lose the instruction book, each bulb is tagged with its unique security code.</figcaption>\r\n</figure>\r\n<p>Once the bulb is screwed into a socket and powered on, you connect your mobile device to it using the iOS Home app&mdash;which serves as Apple&rsquo;s <em>mostly</em> user-friendly frontend for HomeKit. For security reasons you need to enter the bulb&rsquo;s unique identifying code, which is as easy as pointing your smartphone&rsquo;s camera at the instruction booklet, or manually entering the number which is also printed on the actual bulb&mdash;because who keeps track of where instruction manuals end up these days?</p>\r\n<p>Once connected you can use the iOS Home app to give the bulb a custom name, assign it to a room or a larger collection of smart home devices (like a single floor of a home), as well as turning it on or off, adjusting its brightness, or changing its color. Just keep in mind that while Sylvania has positioned the Smart+ bulb as a legitimate 60-watt incandescent replacement, you&rsquo;re only going to see the full 800 lumens of brightness (the same as a 60-watt bulb) when the bulb&rsquo;s color temperature is set to as close as neutral white as possible. When tinted to deeper colors like red or blue, it becomes considerably dimmer.</p>\r\n<figure class=\"js_marquee-assetfigure align--bleed\">\r\n<div class=\"img-wrapper lazy-image \" style=\"max-width: 2000px;\">\r\n<div class=\"img-wrapper lazy-image \" style=\"max-width: 2000px;\">\r\n<div class=\"img-permalink-sub-wrapper img-permalink-sub-wrapper--nobackground\" style=\"padding-bottom: 43.8%;\"><span class=\"js_lightbox-wrapper lightbox-wrapper\"><img class=\"ls-lazy-image-tag cursor-pointer lazyautosizes lazyloaded\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" data-sizes=\"auto\" data-width=\"2000\" data-chomp-id=\"f1fajq892vafdggucn3p\" data-format=\"jpg\" /></span></div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<figcaption>The iOS Home app offers very basic functionality for controlling your bulbs, but few will need more than what it has to offer.</figcaption>\r\n</figure>\r\n<p>Piggybacking on Apple&rsquo;s HomeKit and your iOS devices makes installing and setting up the Smart+ bulb easy, but it does have limitations. Your phone can connect to multiple bulbs using Bluetooth, but each bulb can only be connected to a single mobile device at a time. So you&rsquo;ll have to use the Apple Home app&rsquo;s invite feature to allow other people to control the bulbs synced to your device, and it&rsquo;s not instantly obvious where this feature is hidden. When using the Philips&rsquo; Hue app, a simple tap on the hardware hub allows any device nearby to easily connect to the system.</p>\r\n<div class=\"ad-container js_ad-video row ad-wide ad-top js_ad-video-mobile\">\r\n<div class=\"ad-instream ad-instream--elastic instream-permalink ad-instream__initial\">\r\n<div class=\"elastic__wrapper\">\r\n<div class=\"ad-unit js_ad-unit ad-video js_ad-video\">\r\n<div id=\"ad-container-28399759\" class=\"ad-container js_ad-container\" data-media-type=\"INSTREAM_VIDEO_MOBILE\" data-zone-type=\"INSTREAM_VIDEO_MOBILE\" data-instream-position=\"instream_3\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<p>And because it&rsquo;s designed as a jack-of-all-trades for controlling multiple types of smart home devices, the Home app isn&rsquo;t as fully featured as dedicated bulb apps like those from Philips are. Changing the Smart+ bulb&rsquo;s color through the Home app is rudimentary at best (there are no mood settings, or the ability to color match a photo) and while it&rsquo;s fun to activate your lights using Siri and voice commands, this functionality also works with other smart bulbs, so it&rsquo;s not a Sylvania exclusive.</p>\r\n<p>The use of Bluetooth, which only has a range of about 100 meters, also limits how far you can be while still controlling the Smart+ bulbs from your iPhone or iPad. Philips&rsquo; Hue system has a similar limitation as it uses a protocol called Zigbee to communicate with each bulb, but because its internet-connected base station acts as an intermediary between your device and the bulbs, you can easily control your lights while away from home. To do the same through HomeKit requires yo to have an Apple TV at home, or an iPad left behind, which serve as the bulb-controlling Bluetooth remote in your absence.</p>\r\n<figure class=\"js_marquee-assetfigure align--left\" style=\"width: 970px;\">\r\n<div class=\"img-wrapper lazy-image \" style=\"max-width: 970px;\">\r\n<div class=\"img-wrapper lazy-image \" style=\"max-width: 970px;\">\r\n<div class=\"img-permalink-sub-wrapper\" style=\"padding-bottom: 56.3%;\"><span class=\"js_lightbox-wrapper lightbox-wrapper\"><img class=\"ls-lazy-image-tag cursor-pointer lazyautosizes lazyloaded\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" data-sizes=\"auto\" data-width=\"970\" data-chomp-id=\"cynn6wq0yqxt1vkzzbhe\" data-format=\"jpg\" /></span></div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<figcaption>Easy to install, easy to use, not-so easy to pay for.</figcaption>\r\n</figure>\r\n<p>If your home is already kitted out with Apple gear, then Sylvania&rsquo;s new Smart+ bulbs are easily one of the best options if you&rsquo;re looking for an quick smart home lighting upgrade. Apple will undoubtedly continue to improve the Home app, and the minor hoops you have to jump through to let everyone else in your home control the lights are far from a deal breaker.</p>\r\n<p>What could be, however, is the price. You can get a dumb LED bulb, which will last for decades, for less than five bucks, but each Smart+ bulb will set you back $45&mdash;the same as a single bulb from Philips Hue. To upgrade all the bulbs in my living room alone would cost me $225, and to really take advantage of smart lighting you would want it in every room of your house. That&rsquo;s a lot of money for an Apple fan to spend when a new iPhone is just around the corner.</p>', 'blogimage/x3njqxpglb95igavtdzk.jpg', 1, '2017-10-30 19:10:50', '2017-10-30 19:10:50', NULL);

(36, 'Transform Any Document into a Searchable PDF with Adobe’s Scan App', 12, '<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Using your phone to scan documents isn&rsquo;t anything new. With apps like <a href=\"https://readdle.com/products/scannerpro\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Scanner Pro</a> and <a href=\"http://turboscanapp.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Turbo Scan</a> out there, if you own a smartphone there&rsquo;s pretty much no reason you need to break out the ol&rsquo; flatbed scanner to digitize anything anymore. Heck, even just snapping a photo of a document sans app could probably get the job done in most cases. Even if you&rsquo;ve already found a favorite scanning app, Adobe&rsquo;s new app, aptly <a href=\"https://acrobat.adobe.com/us/en/acrobat/mobile-app/scan-documents.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">named Abobe Scan</a>, is one you&rsquo;re definitely going to want to try.</p>\r\n<div class=\"ad-container js_ad-video row ad-wide ad-top js_ad-video-desktop\">\r\n<div class=\"ad-instream ad-instream--elastic instream-permalink ad-instream__initial\">\r\n<div class=\"elastic__wrapper\">\r\n<div class=\"ad-unit js_ad-unit ad-video js_ad-video\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<p>On the surface, Scan works like all those others apps out there: point your camera at the document, and snap a picture. Adobe takes things a step further, however, and applies optical character recognition (OCR) to the document once it&rsquo;s scanned to transform the printed text on your document into digital text. That means that it will be searchable later on, just as if you had typed it on a computer rather than just taken a photo of it. Text can also be copied or annotated from your scanned document into another doc using Adobe <a href=\"https://get.adobe.com/reader/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Acrobat Reader DC</a> or <a href=\"https://acrobat.adobe.com/us/en/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Acrobat DC</a>.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>And you can scan more than documents. The app can be used to create searchable scans of whiteboards, slides shown during a business meeting, business cards, or things like receipts from a recent trip. When you &ldquo;scan&rdquo; something, Adobe&rsquo;s AI can crop out your coffee table and crumbs from lunch from the pic, remove shadows, and tweak the perspective so it looks like something done on a professional scanner rather than your iPhone.</p>\r\n<p>Scan is free for everyone with an iPhone or Android device to use, but if you&rsquo;re an Adobe Document Cloud customer you&rsquo;ll score some extras such as the ability to use the app to collect signatures and access to some organizational tools.</p>', 'blogimage/sf6ffwrd61qsxoj6fyv3.jpg', 1, '2017-10-30 19:28:50', '2017-10-30 19:28:50', NULL),

The paid version (<a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.estrongs.android.pop.pro\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">$2.99</a>) is reportedly still safe, but we&rsquo;ve decided to update our top pick to reflect this new development.</em></p>\r\n<h3><a href=\"http://neatbytes.com/solidexplorer/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong>Solid Explorer</strong></a></h3>\r\n<p><strong>Platform:</strong> Android<br /><strong>Price:</strong> $1.99 after 14-day free trial<br /><a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=pl.solidexplorer2\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong>Download Page</strong></a></p>\r\n<h3><strong>Features</strong></h3>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Basic file management functions: copy, paste, cut, create, delete, rename, share and send files stored on your SD card or internal memory</li>\r\n<li>Select multiple files at once</li>\r\n<li>Browse Collections of photos, music, and videos in one place</li>\r\n<li>Manage, install, and uninstall apps, plus explore file structure within apps</li>\r\n<li>Open, read, extract, and decrypt ZIP, 7ZIP, RAR and TAR files</li>\r\n<li>Manage cloud files on Dropbox, Box, OneDrive, Google Drive, Sugarsync, Copy, Mediafire, Owncloud, and Yandex</li>\r\n<li>Add more storage options with plugins for Amazo, Mega, and more</li>\r\n<li>Lock access to network locations with password</li>\r\n<li>Use root access to perform root-only actions</li>\r\n<li>Batch rename large groups of files at once with regular expressions or variables</li>\r\n<li>Remotely access files with FTP, SFTP, WebDav, and SMB/CIFS clients</li>\r\n<li>Bookmark folders for quick access later</li>\r\n<li>View images and listen to audio with built-in media player</li>\r\n<li>Cast media to your Chromecast</li>\r\n<li>Customize primary and accent color scheme</li>\r\n<li>Choose between light, dark, and black background themes</li>\r\n<li>Material Design interface</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h3><strong>Where It Excels</strong></h3>\r\n<p>Solid Explorer covers almost all of the beats you&rsquo;d expect from a file manager nearly flawlessly. Collections allow you to view all of your photos, music, and videos in one place. You can connect your cloud storage accounts like Dropbox to manage your files remotely. It also has support for remote access protocols like FTP and you can even use it as a root file manager. Even for advanced users, it packs a punch.</p>\r\n<p>On top of all this, it&rsquo;s also <em>gorgeous</em>. While most file managers have a design stuck somewhere between 2009 and the stone age, Solid Explorer makes it a priority to adhere to Google&rsquo;s <a href=\"http://lifehacker.com/updating-all-the-new-stuff-in-androids-l-release-prev-1595928268\" rel=\"nofollow\">Material Design spec</a>. You can also customize your themes and colors and even choose between light and dark themes, because there&rsquo;s really no reason a file manager should blind you.</p>\r\n<h3><strong>Where It Falls Short</strong></h3>\r\n<p>While we prefer to choose a free app when we can, Solid Explorer doesn&rsquo;t fall into that camp. You can try it for free for two weeks, but after that, you&rsquo;ll have to shell out $2 to keep using it. On top of that, the company also charges for some plugins like Mega, and even offers additional icon packs for more money. This is annoying, but most of the add-ons are either free or optional. The upside is that you at least know where Solid Explorer is getting its money from. Since our last pick was pulled for adding sketchy adware, we&rsquo;ll call this a mixed blessing, rather than an outright negative.</p>\r\n<h3><strong>The Competition</strong></h3>\r\n<p>The free version of ES File Explorer may have lost our recommendation, but if you don&rsquo;t want to say goodbye, you should at least check out <a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.estrongs.android.pop.pro\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong>ES File Explorer Pro</strong></a>. For $2.99, all of the embedded app &ldquo;suggestions&rdquo; and junkware are removed, and there are no ads. It still has all the bells and whistles we used to like, including remote file access, ZIP support, and an app manager. Of course, most of those same features are in Solid Explorer for $1 less.</p>\r\n<p><a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=nextapp.fx\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong>FX File Explorer</strong></a> is also a great option for users who like ES File Explorer&rsquo;s design but don&rsquo;t want the junk. The free version covers the basics of local file management, while you can pay $2.99 to unlock advanced features like cloud or networked storage and an app manager. For basic users, the free version gives an edge over Solid Explorer, but advanced users will end up paying slightly more for the big guns. Though, at the time of this writing, FX File Explorer is running a sale, bringing the price down to $1.99, specifically aiming to court users of ES File Explorer.</p>\r\n<p>It&rsquo;s also worth pointing out that if you don&rsquo;t need much from your file manager, <a href=\"http://lifehacker.com/the-coolest-features-of-android-n-google-didnt-announce-1764114846\" rel=\"nofollow\">Android N will have you covered as well</a>. Google has started building a basic file manager into the system itself. You can copy and move files, rename files and folders, and create new folders all within the system itself. It&rsquo;s a far cry from the advanced features of other apps on this list, and Android N isn&rsquo;t even released yet, but if you&rsquo;re one of the few <a href=\"http://lifehacker.com/how-to-install-the-android-n-developer-preview-on-your-1763813851\" rel=\"nofollow\">running the N Preview</a> or are reading this in the future from an Android N device, you might not need a full file manager app.</p>', 'blogimage/w8q4konpivo2jxwdrjth.jpg', 1, '2017-10-30 19:45:48', '2017-10-30 19:45:48', NULL),

Project plans, scheduling, budget and hours tracking, shopping lists, etc. It&rsquo;s my lifeline.</p>\r\n<p>I also spend A LOT of time scrolling through apps like <a href=\"https://us.letgo.com/en\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Letgo</a>, <a href=\"https://offerup.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">OfferUp</a> and <a href=\"https://apps.facebook.com/marketplace/115061365176794/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Facebook Marketplace</a> for those scenic elements and weird prop items you just can&rsquo;t get on Amazon. They have made sourcing SO MUCH EASIER! I used to have to hunt through all the local thrift stores, flea markets and estate sales, which is super fun but time consuming and discouraging if you can&rsquo;t find what you are looking for. UPS probably has no idea how much weird stuff they&rsquo;ve delivered to my door.</p>\r\n<h4><strong>What&rsquo;s your workspace setup like? </strong></h4>\r\n<p>Ever changing. No two days give me the same view. I do have a desk in our &ldquo;tree house&rdquo; office which ends up being mostly storage of small set dec pieces, things that need fixed or things I just don&rsquo;t want to lose. I spend a majority of my time on the floor during our build season working on and checking in on the many projects we have going at once, which makes having all of my lists available via mobile extremely important. I also have a home office and workshop space that get much use during our creative phase.</p>\r\n<h4><strong>How does your work vary over the course of a year? </strong></h4>\r\n<p>People always ask me, &ldquo;what do you do for the rest of the year?&rdquo; with no idea of just how much work it takes to create new attractions every year. We completely revise and renovate about 10,000 square feet of our attraction every year. October is actually my least busy time of the year because all of the design and build work is finally done. Starting in November our team will start analyzing customer feedback and brainstorming new creative ideas, I&rsquo;ll spend the winter generating budgets and timetables for tearing down the old sets and then building the new stuff, and from spring through September I&rsquo;m here every day supervising the creation of our new sets and theatrical elements.<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n<h4><strong>What&rsquo;s your best time-saving shortcut or life hack?</strong></h4>\r\n<p>I know it&rsquo;s antiquated but I&rsquo;m a total pen and paper kind of girl. I&rsquo;m all about the post-its. I&rsquo;ve got so many things going on at a time that if I don&rsquo;t write things down immediately they are gone forever. I can put them exactly where I need to see them, and they come in so many colors!</p>\r\n<h4><strong>What&rsquo;s your favorite to-do list manager?</strong></h4>\r\n<p>I keep everything Google based. I create a master project workbook for each year in Google Sheets that I update daily, and can share with our management team, and from there transfer our daily to-do lists to a whiteboard in our common area where I can assign tasks, and share the fun of taking that big red marker through each item as we go. Very little is as satisfying to me as crossing off to-do&rsquo;s.</p>\r\n<h4><strong>What everyday thing are you better at than everyone else? What&rsquo;s your secret?</strong></h4>\r\n<p>Screaming! HAHA, you would think that working at a haunted house for the last 10 years would have desensitized me a bit more than it has, but I get a good startle in at least once daily, occasionally resulting in a full-on blood-curdling scream. It&rsquo;s quite amusing for everyone involved.</p>\r\n<h4><strong>What do you listen to while you work?</strong>&nbsp;</h4>\r\n<p>We keep a big Bluetooth speaker in the common area and we take turns choosing the music. As far as radio goes, I&rsquo;m a classic rock girl, although 90s pop is super fun to work to, too. Our Costume Designer recently got me into true crime podcasts (primarily <a href=\"https://www.myfavoritemurder.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">My Favorite Murder</a>), so that happens too sometimes. Also show tunes! <em>Hamilton</em>, <em>Les Mis</em>, <em>Phantom</em>, <em>In the Heights</em>... The list goes on. But I usually try to save that for when I&rsquo;m working alone.</p>\r\n<aside class=\"inset--story js_inset branded-item branded-item--lifehacker\">\r\n<figure><img class=\"lazyautosizes lazyloaded\" src=\"https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/s--Dj-WUTV1--/c_fill,fl_progressive,g_north,h_77,q_80,w_137/r7eswvoqm8ngfybofmvd.jpg\" alt=\"Article preview thumbnail\" data-sizes=\"auto\" /></figure>\r\n<div class=\"inset--story__content\">\r\n<h6 class=\"inset--story__headline\"><a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/nine-spooky-podcasts-guaranteed-to-frighten-you-1819292798\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Nine Spooky Podcasts Guaranteed to Frighten You</a></h6>\r\n<p>It&rsquo;s that special time of year again when everyone is looking for a good scary story.

I&rsquo;m mostly into fantasy or books about monsters. We&rsquo;ll assume the obvious Harry Potter, LOTR, Rice and King. But Phillip Pullman, Tamora Pierce and Laurel K. Hamilton are definitely high on my &ldquo;would recommend&rdquo; list.</p>\r\n<h4><strong>How do you recharge? What do you do when you want to forget about work?</strong></h4>\r\n<p>Scary movies, obviously! We try to watch a different one nearly every night. I&rsquo;m actually watching <em>Silence of the Lambs</em> as I write this! We love to travel when we have the time, which is often tricky. My boyfriend is a photographer, so free time, when it lines up, is immediately booked with some sort of adventure. I also have a very needy Jack Russel named Wesley. He knows very many tricks but only does them when HE decides it absolutely necessary. He is also a master of disguise.</p>\r\n<h4><strong>What&rsquo;s your favorite side project?</strong></h4>\r\n<p>CRAFTS! I love to make things. I&rsquo;m always working on something, whether it&rsquo;s a handmade gift or an art project. I started selling masquerade masks at the local renaissance festival years ago as a creative outlet while I was finishing school, which has morphed many times, most recently into soy candles and live terrariums this past season.</p>\r\n<h4><strong>What&rsquo;s your sleep routine like? Are you a night owl or early riser?</strong></h4>\r\n<p>100% owl. I have a real hard time shutting it down at the end of the day. Especially if it has been a very productive day, I&rsquo;m super amped up and want to finish all the things. And therefore mornings can be pretty rough. I have 3 wake-up alarms set at 5-minute intervals, and another that goes off 10 minutes before I have to leave my house. And a very tolerant boyfriend. Most of my team works the same way. We keep soft start times during build season because of this. And nothing ever happens before coffee.</p>\r\n<h4><strong>Fill in the blank: I&rsquo;d love to see _________ answer these same questions.</strong></h4>\r\n<p>[<em>Ghost Hunters</em> investigator] Amy Bruni</p>\r\n<h4><strong>What&rsquo;s the best advice you&rsquo;ve ever received?</strong></h4>\r\n<p>If the answer is not &ldquo;Hell Yes&rdquo; then it has to be &ldquo;No.&rdquo; Especially when you are as busy as I am, it&rsquo;s okay to be picky about what projects or commitments you take on. You have to be, if you value your sanity.</p>\r\n<aside class=\"inset--story js_inset branded-item branded-item--lifehacker\">\r\n<figure><img class=\"lazyautosizes lazyloaded\" src=\"https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/s--lN0eadcY--/c_fill,fl_progressive,g_north,h_77,q_80,w_137/18ix7gg5hbyonjpg.jpg\" alt=\"Article preview thumbnail\" data-sizes=\"auto\" /></figure>\r\n<div class=\"inset--story__content\">\r\n<h6 class=\"inset--story__headline\"><a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/5875337/how-to-say-no-without-being-an-asshole\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">How to Say No (Without Being an Asshole)</a></h6>\r\n<p>We aim to please, and so saying \"no\" to a request can be a hard thing to do.

I think many people think it&rsquo;s just kids in rubber masks hiding behind black plastic. But there&rsquo;s often a tremendous amount of work and creativity on display in your local haunted house. We spend all year creating new sets, characters, and effects that are just as impactful as what you might see in a Hollywood movie. These haunts aren&rsquo;t just for kids.
